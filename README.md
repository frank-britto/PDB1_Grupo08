## Telerehabilitation system for remote monitoring of unsupervised exercises of post COVID-19 patients



Considering the current context in Peru, i.e experimenting an inminent [second wave of infection](https://opencovid-peru.com/) due to COVID-19 and a political fragility that endangers the correct distribution of resources (money and human resources) to the health sector, it´s evident the need for generating preventive and rapid-response solutions to reduce the impacto of COVID-19 in Peru. One of those consequence it the **post icu syndrome**, caused by a prolonged stay in the ICU due to the need for mechanical ventilation in mild and severe cases of COVID-19.

Any irregularity in the continuity of the rehabilitation of post icu patients increases the risk of their hospital readmision, saturating health services that are already working to their limit due to the increasing demand for health services during the pandemic. In this context, our project emerges as an alternative for the remote monitoring of unsupervised post COVID-19 patients with one principal objective: reduce the burden on rehabilitation institutions.

The presente system constitutes a tool that trained health personnel can prescribe to ambulatory patients as a complement for their rehabilitation program. The aim of this project is to avoid hospital readmission. Hence, the system´s prototype, made up of a vital sign´s module and a smartphone app, is based on key components that adresses user needs such as the adherence to home-based rehabilitation program and the visualtization of the patient´s progress in time.



## Documentation

The present project constitutes the final assessment of the course [Project of Biodesign 1](https://biodesign-project-1.github.io/) of the undergraduate program of Biomedical Engineering PUCP-UPCH. It was elaborated following the Design Thinking methodology for the problem definition and the identification of needs, and the VDI 2225 methodology for the elaboratorion of the prototype.
